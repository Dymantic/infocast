        <h3 class="normal tc head0 mt0 pv5">Who We Are</h3>
        <p class="f4 f3-ns tl mh4 mb3 measure-wide center-l lh-max">We make knowledge more accessible to everybody by revolutionizing the data classification process and labeling of information to provide simplified analysis. This design of information processing disrupts the current information consumption process and empowers users to discover further value of data. </p>

        <p class="f4 f3-ns tl mh4 mb3 measure-wide center-l lh-max">Our motivation stems from a core belief that it currently takes far too long to locate and consume information on the web, making it burdensome to compile information into a usable format. This scattered data format is rarely extracted in a format that can be easily sorted and filtered.</p>

        <h3 class="normal tc head0 mt0 pv5">Our Vision</h3>
        <p class="f4 f3-ns tl mh4 mb3 measure-wide center-l lh-max">We envision a world where anyone can easily accelerate data utilization of specialized and organized information extracted from the web. We aim to speed up the process of finding, creating, analyzing, and publishing hard-to-find, structured information by removing all technical barriers in data services. </p>

        <p class="f4 f3-ns tl mh4 mb3 measure-wide center-l lh-max">It is our goal to give the average person the same resources that large businesses have to curate and commercialize highly structured information, so the rest of us can find and use that data quicker.</p>
